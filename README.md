```css
.accordion-content {
    font-size: 0.75rem;
    max-height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    transition: max-height 0.4s;
}

.accordion input:checked~.accordion-content {
    max-height: 100%;
}

.accordion input:checked~label::after {
    content: url("images/icon-arrow-down.svg");
    height: 100%;
    transform: rotate(180deg);
}
```

### Continued development

I will keep learning these simple trick of css in future and my focus on js.
